# Deep-learning-Recurrent-Neutral-Networks-RNNs

Part 1: Introduction to Tensor flow

TensorFlow is a software library extensively used in machine learning. TensorFlow 2 will be used which affords great flexibility and the ability to imperatively execute operations, just like in Python. TensorFlow 2 is quite similar to Python in its syntax and imperative execution.

Part 2: Music generation using RRNs

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) will be applied for music generation. A model will be trained to learn the patterns in raw sheet music in ABC notation and generate new music.
